The program is about implementing a bounded queue with operation of enqueue and dequeue.
I implement the queue using array with 2 indexes named first, last to control the elements    to enqueue and dequeue.
In test.cpp it reads queue boundary from command line.(You can try any big number, it runs fast.)
